# SystemVerilog/UVM Expert Review Feature

## Overview

The **Expert Review** feature adds a production-quality code review layer by engaging a Senior SystemVerilog/UVM expert to analyze and improve generated verification code. This ensures that your assertions and covergroups meet industry standards and best practices.

## How It Works

### Pipeline Integration

When enabled, the expert review adds an additional quality assurance step to the processing pipeline:

**Standard Pipeline (6 steps):**
1. Document Upload
2. Text Extraction
3. Requirements Analysis
4. Code Generation
5. Basic Review
6. File Extraction

**Expert-Reviewed Pipeline (7 steps):**
1. Document Upload
2. Text Extraction
3. Requirements Analysis
4. Code Generation
5. Basic Review
6. **🎓 Expert Review & Improvement** ← NEW
7. File Extraction

**Vision + Expert Pipeline (8 steps):**
1. Document Upload
2. Vision Filtering (AI-powered page relevance scoring)
3. Text Extraction (filtered pages only)
4. Requirements Analysis
5. Code Generation
6. Basic Review
7. **🎓 Expert Review & Improvement** ← NEW
8. File Extraction

### Expert Scoring System

The SystemVerilog expert evaluates code on a **0-10 scale** based on 8 critical criteria:

1. **Syntax Correctness** - Proper SystemVerilog syntax, compilable code
2. **SVA Best Practices** - Correct assertion/coverage idioms, proper temporal operators
3. **Coverage Adequacy** - Comprehensive bins, transitions, cross-coverage
4. **Naming Conventions** - Clear, consistent, industry-standard naming
5. **Documentation** - Meaningful comments, requirement traceability
6. **Code Organization** - Logical grouping, proper encapsulation
7. **Completeness** - All requirements addressed, no gaps
8. **Production Readiness** - Simulation-ready, no hardcoded values

**Score Interpretation:**
- **8-10:** Production-ready, meets professional standards
- **5-7:** Good but needs improvements
- **0-4:** Requires significant enhancement

### Automatic Improvements

If the expert score is **less than 8**, the code is automatically enhanced:

```
📊 Expert Score: 6/10
🔧 Applying expert improvements...
✓ Code enhanced by SV/UVM expert
```

If the score is **8 or higher**, the code is accepted as-is:

```
📊 Expert Score: 9/10
✓ Code meets production standards
```

## Expert Review Output

The expert provides detailed feedback in the following format:

```
SCORE: 7/10

STRENGTHS:
- Correct SVA syntax with proper temporal operators
- Good coverage of basic scenarios
- Clear assertion names

ISSUES:
- Missing reset checks in several assertions
- Incomplete coverage of corner cases (min/max values)
- Hardcoded values instead of parameters

IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Add reset condition checks: `!rst_n && !signal`
2. Add bins for boundary values (0, max, overflow)
3. Replace magic numbers with parameters
4. Add cross-coverage between related signals

BEST PRACTICES:
- Use clocking blocks for sampling
- Add sequence definitions for complex temporal patterns
- Include formal properties for critical paths

OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
- Consider adding cover properties for interesting scenarios
- Add assertion for protocol compliance
```

## When to Use Expert Review

### ✅ Recommended For:

- **Production code** - Code destined for real projects
- **Critical designs** - Safety-critical or mission-critical systems
- **Team environments** - Code shared across teams needs consistency
- **Learning purposes** - Get expert feedback to improve your skills
- **Complex requirements** - Documents with intricate verification needs

### ❌ Not Necessary For:

- **Quick prototypes** - Rough code for experimentation
- **Simple documents** - Basic requirements with straightforward verification
- **Performance testing** - When you want to compare processing speed

## Enabling/Disabling Expert Review

### In the GUI:

1. Look for the **🎓 SystemVerilog/UVM Expert Review** checkbox
2. **Checked (default):** Expert review enabled
3. **Unchecked:** Skip expert review for faster processing

### Performance Impact:

- **With Expert Review:** ~30-45 seconds additional processing time
- **Without Expert Review:** Standard processing time
- **Recommendation:** Leave enabled unless time is critical

## Expert Capabilities

The SystemVerilog/UVM expert has deep knowledge in:

### Assertion Expertise:

- Temporal operators (`##`, `|->`, `|=>`)
- Sequences and properties
- Formal verification considerations
- Clock and reset handling
- Disable conditions
- Vacuity checking

### Coverage Expertise:
- Covergroups and coverpoints
- Bins (explicit, wildcard, ranges, transitions)
- Cross-coverage with `iff` conditions
- Sampling events and clocking blocks
- Coverage options (weight, goal, at_least)
- Illegal bins and ignore bins
- Functional coverage methodologies

### UVM/OVM Best Practices:
- Proper component hierarchy
- Sequence generation patterns
- Scoreboard implementations
- Coverage collection strategies

## Enumeration and Requirement Preservation

The expert reviewer **respects and preserves** all requirement enumerations and descriptions from your source documents:

### Assertions Example:

**Source Document:**
```
REQ-001 (Priority: HIGH): Clock must be stable during reset
REQ-002 (Priority: MEDIUM): Data valid only when enable is high
```

**Expert-Reviewed Output:**
```systemverilog
// REQ-001 (Priority: HIGH): Clock must be stable during reset
property clk_stable_during_reset;
  @(posedge clk) $rose(rst_n) |-> $stable(clk);
endproperty
assert_clk_stable: assert property (clk_stable_during_reset);

// REQ-002 (Priority: MEDIUM): Data valid only when enable is high
property data_valid_when_enabled;
  @(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n)
    data_valid |-> enable;
endproperty
assert_data_valid: assert property (data_valid_when_enabled);
```

### Coverage Example:

**Source Document:**
```
TC-001: Verify all priority levels (LOW=0, MED=1, HIGH=2)
TC-002: Check state transitions (IDLE→ACTIVE→DONE)
```

**Expert-Reviewed Output:**
```systemverilog
covergroup priority_cg @(posedge clk);
  option.comment = "TC-001: Verify all priority levels";
  
  cp_priority: coverpoint priority {
    bins low  = {0};  // LOW priority
    bins med  = {1};  // MEDIUM priority
    bins high = {2};  // HIGH priority
    option.comment = "Priority levels: LOW=0, MED=1, HIGH=2";
  }
endgroup

covergroup state_transition_cg @(posedge clk);
  option.comment = "TC-002: Check state transitions";
  
  cp_state_trans: coverpoint state {
    bins idle_to_active = (IDLE => ACTIVE);
    bins active_to_done = (ACTIVE => DONE);
    bins full_sequence  = (IDLE => ACTIVE => DONE);
    option.comment = "State transitions: IDLE→ACTIVE→DONE";
  }
endgroup
```

## Example Expert Improvement

### Before Expert Review (Score: 6/10):

```systemverilog
// Basic assertion
assert property (@(posedge clk) enable |-> data_valid);

// Simple coverage
coverpoint mode {
  bins values[] = {[0:3]};
}
```

### After Expert Review (Score: 9/10):

```systemverilog
// REQ-045: Data must be valid within 1 cycle when enable asserts
property data_valid_on_enable;
  @(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n)
    $rose(enable) |=> data_valid;
endproperty
assert_data_valid: assert property (data_valid_on_enable)
  else $error("Data not valid after enable assertion");

// TC-012: Verify all operating modes with transitions
covergroup mode_cg @(posedge clk);
  option.comment = "TC-012: Operating mode coverage";
  
  cp_mode: coverpoint mode {
    bins idle   = {0};
    bins normal = {1};
    bins turbo  = {2};
    bins sleep  = {3};
    option.comment = "All operating modes: IDLE=0, NORMAL=1, TURBO=2, SLEEP=3";
  }
  
  cp_mode_trans: coverpoint mode {
    bins idle_to_normal = (0 => 1);
    bins normal_to_turbo = (1 => 2);
    bins turbo_to_normal = (2 => 1);
    bins normal_to_sleep = (1 => 3);
    bins sleep_to_idle = (3 => 0);
  }
endgroup
```

**Improvements Applied:**
- ✅ Added reset disable condition
- ✅ Used `$rose()` for clean edge detection
- ✅ Added `$error()` for debugging
- ✅ Separated value bins from transition bins
- ✅ Added meaningful comments with test case IDs
- ✅ Documented mode values explicitly
- ✅ Covered realistic transitions
